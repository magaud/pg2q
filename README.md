* Models of projective plane geometry
In pg(2,q), there are (q^2+q+1) points, and also (q^2+q+1) lines. Each line contains (q+1) points, and dually each point is incident to exactly (q+1) lines. 

* Issues
 + Baer subplanes ?
 + in AISC 2018, Desargues is proved in pg(2,2) and pg(2,3)...
 + find counterexamples of Desargues theorem in Hall, Dual Hall or Hugues projective planes
 + show that the 4 planes of order 9 are not isomorphic (collineations in order 9)
